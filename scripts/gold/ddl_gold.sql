# ðŸ’° View: `gold.fact_sales`

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose
The `gold.fact_sales` view defines the **sales fact table** in the gold layer of the data warehouse. 
  It captures transactional sales data and enriches it with dimensional keys from `dim_products` and `dim_customers`,
  enabling robust analytical queries and reporting.

  ðŸ§  Usage Notes
This view is designed for use in star schema models and BI dashboards.
Joins are performed using LEFT JOIN to preserve sales records even if dimensional data is incomplete.
Surrogate keys (product_key, customer_key) support efficient joins and aggregations.
